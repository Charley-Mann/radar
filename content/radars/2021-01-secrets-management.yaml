    bio: |
      Engineering and co-founder at AuthKeys. Used to be an embedded engineer for more than a decade AuthKeys was my opportunity to turn into cloud native aware technologies. Going up and down the stack there, my main interests fall into revision control, CI/CD and anything in tech that helps managing complexity yet allowing things to scale at need.
