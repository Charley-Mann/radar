- title: What is a Technology Radar?
  content: |
    A technology radar is an opinionated guide to a set of emerging technologies. The popular format originated at [Thoughtworks](https://assets.thoughtworks.com/assets/technology-radar-vol-21-en.pdf) and has been adopted by dozens of companies including [Zalando](https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/), [AOE](https://www.aoe.com/techradar/index.html), [Porsche](https://medium.com/porschedev/technology-radar-vol-2-4833fb31e2fd), Spotify, and Intuit.
    
    The key idea is to place solutions at one of four levels, reflecting advice you would give to someone who is choosing a solution:
    <dl>
      <dt>Adopt</dt>
      <dd>The CNCF End User Community can clearly recommend this technology. We have used it for long periods of time in many teams and it has
          proven to be stable and useful</dd>

      <dt>Trial</dt>
      <dd>The CNCF End User Community has used it with success and recommend to have a closer look at the technology in this ring</dd>

      <dt>Assess</dt>
      <dd>The CNCF End User Community has tried it out and we find it promising. We recommend having a look at these items when you face a
        specific need for the technology in your project.</dd>
    </dl>
- title: Methodology
  content: |
    For each CNCF End User Technology Radar, five companies are randomly chosen from the CNCF End User Community and asked to form an editorial Radar Team. Once the Radar Team chooses a topic, the 140 companies in the CNCF End User Community are asked to describe what their companies recommend for a list of different technology solutions: Hold, Assess, Trial, or Adopt. They can also give more detailed comments. As the answers are submitted via a Google Spreadsheet, they are neither private nor anonymized within the group.
    
    The Radar Team curate the responses, choose final outcomes, and describe any patterns or themes they see in the data or from their own experience.

    ##### What's the difference between the CNCF End User Technology Radar and other technology radars?
    
    Compared to the ThoughtWorks radar, the CNCF End User Technology Radar is community-driven and represents the experience across dozens of companies. Cloud native moves very fast, so instead of doing an annual radar covering all topics, the CNCF End User Technology Radar covers one topic per quarter.
    
    In terms of format, there is no Hold ring and no quadrants, which are primarily used for organizing dense radars.
    
    ##### Why is there no “Hold” data in the CNCF End User Technology Radar?

    The Radar focuses on future adoption, so we have chosen not to include a Hold ring. 
    
    ##### How are the topics and technologies chosen?
    
    The Technology Radar team chooses the topic based on [suggestions from the community](https://github.com/cncf/enduser-public/issues/35) and their own interests and expertise. The team comes up with a list of technologies in the space, but End User Community members who respond to the survey can also add tools they are familiar with that are not already on the list.

    ##### Does the Tech Radar reflect the whole market?
    
    No, the End User Community is comprised of mostly early adopters looking at modern use cases.
    
    ##### Is this a prediction for the future? 
    
    No, it’s a look at what’s currently being used today.
    
    ##### What is going to happen with this information? 
    
    It’s advisory for the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) and Special Interest Groups (SIGs) for when they decide which projects go in and out of CNCF.
    
    ##### Is the Tech Radar always about tools, or will it also cover other things such as approaches? 
    
    It’s designed to be flexible, so future Radar Teams may decide to survey the End User Community about things other than tools.
    
    ##### How do I get my project on the Technology Radar?
    
    Vendors and project maintainers can tell your end users to the Technology Radar and encourage them to join the End User Community so they can participate.
    
    ##### How do I participate in the next Technology Radar?
    
    [Join the End User Community](https://www.cncf.io/people/end-user-community/) to weigh in on the next Technology Radar.
    
    ##### How do I join the next Radar Team?
    
    Be a member of the [End User Community](https://www.cncf.io/people/end-user-community/), and either volunteer or be randomly selected. Email us at info@cncf.io if you'd like to volunteer.

    ##### Who drives the poll?
    
    CNCF runs it, but it’s community-driven from the End User Community.
    
    ##### Can I create my own technology radar?
    
    Feel free to fork [this repo](https://github.com/cncf/radar) and run your own.
    
    ##### Whom do I contact with questions?
    
    Email info@cncf.io.
